ABOUT
=====
A script for people who want to develop for Real VMX, a VxWorks-like
operating system kernel. The script installs ext2, GRUB, and a vanilla
kernel to a small (32 MiB) QEMU image.

Some features of Real VMX:

    * Priority-based multitasking and round robin scheduling
    * Partition-based memory management
    * Binary, counting, and mutex semaphores with priority-inheritance
    * Message queues for inter-process communication
    * Virtual memory

Real VMX is licensed under the LGPL.

USAGE
=====
To create an image in the current directory, run:

    $ ./setup-vmx

This will create a 32 MiB image stored in `real-vmx.img'. Read the
script to get a hint on how to rebuild Real VMX and put a new kernel in
the image.
